# Project Status

This file tracks the current state of Hyperfluid's build pipeline. It is separate from the build system definition so that the build system can remain focused on process while this file evolves with the project.

## Current Phase

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 0: Research Audit | COMPLETE |
| Phase 0: Decentralisation Audit | COMPLETE (issues in `docs/01-research/_overengineered.md`, fixes applied) |
| Phase 1: Requirements | COMPLETE (190 requirements: 160 FR + 30 NFR) |
| Phase 2: Architecture | NOT STARTED |
| Phase 3: Specifications | NOT STARTED |
| Phase 4: Planning | NOT STARTED |
| Phase 5+: Build | NOT STARTED |

## Research Gaps (RESOLVED - converted to Layer 2 requirements)

All gaps were either resolved in research or converted to explicit FR/NFR items. See `docs/02-requirements/index.md` "Gaps Addressed" for mapping.

| Gap | Should Live In | Status | Resolved In |
|-----|----------------|--------|-------------|
| Token budget resource model (LOCAL runtime only) | `runtime/agent-runtime-spec.md` | **RESOLVED** | FR-0073, FR-0074, FR-0075 |
| VDF-based committee randomness | `protocol/consensus-spec.md` | **RESOLVED** | FR-0003 |
| Reviewer independence / operator-cluster diversity | `runtime/review-engine-spec.md` | **RESOLVED** | FR-0099, FR-0033 |
| No-vote timeout fairness proof | `protocol/governance-spec.md` | **RESOLVED** | FR-0029 (with validation deferred note) |
| Plan replay protection E2E | `runtime/policy-engine-spec.md` + storage specs | **RESOLVED** | FR-0108 (E2E trace deferred to Layer 6) |
| Telemetry threat model | `security/` research → specs | **RESOLVED** | NFR-0020, NFR-0021 |
| Sandbox escape analysis | `security/` research → specs | **RESOLVED** | FR-0137 (full threat model still needed before Layer 4) |
| Content-addressing SLA | `storage/artifact-availability-spec.md` | **RESOLVED** | FR-0057 |
| Economic timing parameters | `protocol/` specs | **RESOLVED** | FR-0148, FR-0149, FR-0150, FR-0169 |

## Decentralisation Audit Status

**Result:** PASS (with fixes applied)

See `docs/01-research/_overengineered.md` for:
- Original issues found
- Proposed fixes
- Applied corrections across research documents

Key fixes:
1. Per-IP rate limits removed from protocol, demoted to local DoS hardening
2. Airdrop anti-Sybil replaced with pubkey-bound challenge + locked bond (from airdrop, not upfront)
3. Manual reviewer triggers replaced with deterministic fallbacks + 3-reviewer floor
4. Token burn removed from protocol economics, kept as local runtime concern
5. Committee randomness changed from drand to on-chain VDF from genesis
6. Geographic reviewer spread replaced with operator-cluster diversity via stake-graph analysis

## Blockers

None.

## Next Actions

1. Begin Layer 3 (Architecture): component boundaries, trust boundaries, ADRs
2. Map each FR to an architecture component; identify orphans
3. Update traceability matrix: Research -> Requirement -> ADR links
4. Begin Layer 4 (Specifications) for highest-priority components:
   - `protocol/consensus-spec.md` (FR-0001 through FR-0020)
   - `runtime/agent-runtime-spec.md` (FR-0061 through FR-0075)
   - `runtime/policy-engine-spec.md` (FR-0106 through FR-0120)
